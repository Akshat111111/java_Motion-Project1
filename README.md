Java's Swing library is particularly well-suited for building simple 2D game engines. Java Swing allows for the creation of window-based applications, making it an appropriate choice for games that require a graphical user interface (GUI).

A game engine developed in Java Swing might include a system for adding different shapes — everything from simple shapes like rectangles and circles to complex, custom shapes. These shapes could serve various functions in a game: they could represent players, enemies, power-ups, or aspects of the game environment.

These shapes would have properties associated with them. First, there might be a color property, which determines the color of the shape in the game interface. Additionally, position properties would define where on the screen the shape initially appears.

The game engine could also include adjustable speed properties for each shape. This might determine how quickly a shape moves across the screen, or how quickly a player's character can run or jump. This movement could follow real-world physics rules, adding realism to the game-play.

Another essential property to consider is 'bounce'. This could determine how the shapes interact with each other upon collision — like how a ball might bounce off a wall — or how they react upon hitting the ground after falling.

Building a simple game engine like this in Java Swing would require an understanding of event-handling (to connect player inputs with in-game actions), rendering (to visually represent the game's elements on the screen), and probably some basic physics to handle movement and collisions.

Before you can churn out a great game with this engine, you need to design and develop its core components like the game loop and object system, to name a few. With these elements in place, you could add new features, like power-ups or revamp your game's physics engine, to customize it to your liking.
